👋 Hi, I’m Rachel Ka-Ying Tsui (@rachelkytsui)
- 📍 Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher with [Dr. Reiko Mazuka](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/faculty/r.mazuka/) at [Laboratory for Language Development (RIKEN CBS)](https://lang-dev-lab.brain.riken.jp/index-english.html) in Japan.
- 🔎 My research focuses on infant language acquisition, bilingualism, and cross-cultural differences.
- 📊 One thing I enjoy most about research is analyzing and visualizing data.
- 🗣 I speak Cantonese (native), English, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese.
- 📫 You can reach me through my twitter [@rachelkytsui](https://twitter.com/rachelkytsui) or my email rachelkytsui [at] gmail.com
